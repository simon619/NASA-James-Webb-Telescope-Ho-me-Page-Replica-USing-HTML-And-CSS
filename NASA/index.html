            <h2>First Images From The James Webb Space Telescope</h2>
            <p>The dawn of a new era in astronomy has begun as the world gets its first look at the full capabilities of NASA's 
                James Webb Space Telescope, a partnership with ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency). The 
                telescope's first full-color images and spectroscopic data were released during a televised broadcast at 10:30 
                a.m. EDT (14:30 UTC) on Tuesday, July 12, 2022, from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. 
                These listed targets below represent the first wave of full-color scientific images and spectra the observatory 
                has gathered, and the official beginning of Webb's general science operations. They were selected by an international 
                committee of representatives from NASA, ESA, CSA, and the Space Telescope Science Institute.</p>

            <h2>OUR RESEARCH</h2>
            <p>
                Stephan's Quintet, a visual grouping of five galaxies, is best known for being prominently featured in the holiday classic 
                film, “It's a Wonderful Life.” Today, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope reveals Stephan's Quintet in a new light. This 
                enormous mosaic is Webb's largest image to date, covering about one-fifth of the Moon's diameter. It contains over 150 
                million pixels and is constructed from almost 1,000 separate image files. The information from Webb provides new insights 
                into how galactic interactions may have driven galaxy evolution in the early universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                With its powerful, infrared vision and extremely high spatial resolution, Webb shows never-before-seen details in this galaxy 
                group. Sparkling clusters of millions of young stars and starburst regions of fresh star birth grace the image. Sweeping tails 
                of gas, dust and stars are being pulled from several of the galaxies due to gravitational interactions. Most dramatically, Webb 
                captures huge shock waves as one of the galaxies, NGC 7318B, smashes through the cluster.
            </p>
            <p>
                ASA's James Webb Space Telescope has produced the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date. Known as 
                Webb's First Deep Field, this image of galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 is overflowing with detail.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thousands of galaxies - including the faintest objects ever observed in the infrared - have appeared in Webb's view for the first time. 
                This slice of the vast universe covers a patch of sky approximately the size of a grain of sand held at arm's length by someone on the ground.
